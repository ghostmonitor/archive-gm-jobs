## **Why Recart?**

**Recart makes more money for ecommerce stores.**

In the last twenty years, ecommerce has completely revolutionized the retail world. It went from being a non-existent business model to becoming a potential threat to the traditional mall as we know it.

Jeff Bezos shipped Amazonâ€™s first ever online book sale in 1995. We consumers haven't looked back since. Data released last September indicated that we were about to spend $1,922,000,000,000 ($1.9 trillion) on online stores in 2016.

The evolution of ecommerce has inevitably brought competition to the market. Approximately **1200 ecommerce stores open every day** and join the 1.6 million already existing ones. The growth of ecommerce is unstoppable, which creates new challenges for merchant

Consumers can buy from more sites at a cheaper price and we get distracted more and more often. There is a huge amount of noise out there. All this leads to a phenomenon often referred to as 'cart abandonment'. People are abandoning their shopping carts more than ever. The cart abandonment rate is 80% today - so 80 of 100 carts are never checked out. This leads to an average online entrepreneur **losing $400 revenue on every $100 made**. 

We believe these changes are forcing ecommerce merchants to seek new approaches. The $4.6 trillion lost revenue in 2015 created a movement to shift the funnel of ecommerce stores. **We will dedicate the next five years to help tens of thousands of ecommerce merchants earn more.**

The war for more dollars has begun.

## **Us**

Recart was started by Soma Toth, Peter Bodnar, Gergo Barcza and David Papp on the summer of 2015. After Soma and Peter founded and ran 7-figure e-commerce stores together and learned the difficulties of e-commerce the hard way, they decided to build a SaaS to overcome them. The Recart launched (named GhostMonitor) in May 2016 and already has 1000 active users.

The launch team. We rebranded GhostMonitor to Recart 2 months ago.

At Recart, we're chasing the American Dream. Our founders spend a lot of time in the Silicon Valley and our clients & advisors are mostly from the United States as well.
