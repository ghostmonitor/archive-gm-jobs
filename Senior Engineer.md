## **Why GhostMonitor?**

In the last twenty years, e-commerce has completely revolutionized the retail world. It went from being a non-existent business model to becoming a potential threat to the traditional mall as we know it.

Jeff Bezos shipped Amazon’s first ever online book sale in 1995. We consumers haven't looked back since. Data released this September indicates that we're about to spend $1,922,000,000,000 ($1.9 trillion) on online stores in 2016.

The evolution of e-commerce has inevitably brought competition to the market. Approximately **1200 e-commerce stores open every day** and join the 1.6 million already existing ones. The growth of e-commerce is unstoppable, which creates new challenges for e-commerce merchants.

Consumers can buy from more sites at a cheaper price and we get distracted more and more often. There is a huge amount of noise out there. All this leads to a phenomenon often referred to as 'cart abandonment'. People are abandoning their shopping carts more than ever. The cart abandonment rate is 80% today - so 80 of 100 carts are never checked out. This leads to an average online entrepreneur **losing $400 revenue on every $100 made**. 

We believe these changes are forcing e-commerce merchants to seek new approaches. The $4 trillion lost revenue in 2014 created a movement to shift the funnel of e-commerce stores. **We will dedicate the next five years to help tens of thousands of e-commerce merchants earn more.**

The war for more dollars has begun.

## **Us**

GhostMonitor was started by Soma Toth and Peter Bodnar. After they founded and ran 7-figure e-commerce stores together and learned the difficulties of e-commerce the hard way, they decided to build a SaaS to overcome them. The company launched in May 2016, and already has 1000 active users.

We're self-funded and stable. We pay the bills from our e-commerce profits. However, we receive a number of investment offers every month, so it's possible to take some investment in the future.

## **Perks**

This is a **HALF SIT-IN POSITION**. We'd love you to join us at our 13. district, Budapest Lehel square office about 3 times a week.

Many companies will offer unlimited paid vacation - which let's face it, usually means no vacation at all. Instead of making false promises, we want to know what's important to you, and how we can make that happen.

Do you want...

* a top end laptop?
* to visit the greatest companies in the Silicon Valley?
* to build your own team?
* GhostMonitor stocks?
* more autonomy?
* to organize your own time?

Whilst we can't provide all of the above, you tell us what's most important to you and we'll help make it a reality.

You're not going to become a millionaire _in the first few months_ - since we offer 400-600,000 HUF, but we propose you stock options and an advanced salary growth timetable. If the company wins - you win as well. 

We're small right now, but there's a huge opprtunity for aggressive expansion. Don't forget: the e-commerce won't stop growing.
