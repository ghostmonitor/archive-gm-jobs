## **Why GhostMonitor?**

In the last twenty years, e-commerce has completely revolutionized the retail world. It went from being a non-existent business model to becoming a potential threat to the traditional mall as we know it.

Jeff Bezos shipped Amazonâ€™s first ever online book sale in 1995. We consumers haven't looked back since. Data released this September indicates that we're about to spend $1,922,000,000,000 ($1.9 trillion) on online stores in 2016.

The evolution of e-commerce has inevitably brought competition to the market. Approximately **1200 e-commerce stores open every day** and join the 1.6 million already existing ones. The growth of e-commerce is unstoppable, which creates new challenges for e-commerce merchants.

Consumers can buy from more sites at a cheaper price and we get distracted more and more often. There is a huge amount of noise out there. All this leads to a phenomenon often referred to as 'cart abandonment'. People are abandoning their shopping carts more than ever. The cart abandonment rate is 80% today - so 80 of 100 carts are never checked out. This leads to an average online entrepreneur **losing $400 revenue on every $100 made**. 

We believe these changes are forcing e-commerce merchants to seek new approaches. The $4 trillion lost revenue in 2014 created a movement to shift the funnel of e-commerce stores. **We will dedicate the next five years to help tens of thousands of e-commerce merchants earn more.**

The war for more dollars has begun.

## **Us**

GhostMonitor was started by Soma Toth and Peter Bodnar. After they founded and ran 7-figure e-commerce stores together and learned the difficulties of e-commerce the hard way, they decided to build a SaaS to overcome them. The company launched in May 2016, and already has 1000 active users.
